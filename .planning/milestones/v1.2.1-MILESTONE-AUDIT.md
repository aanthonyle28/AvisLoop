# Milestone v1.2.1 Audit Report

**Milestone:** v1.2.1 (Tech Debt Closure)
**Audited:** 2026-02-01
**Status:** PASSED — All tech debt items from v1.2 audit resolved, no critical gaps

## Milestone Scope

v1.2.1 was created to close tech debt identified in the [v1.2 audit](.planning/v1.2-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md). It contains 2 phases:

| Phase | Name | Goal |
|-------|------|------|
| 17 | Deployment & Critical Fixes | Fix deployment blocker (missing migration) + Phase 4 formal verification |
| 18 | Code Cleanup | Orphaned files, inline constant duplication, stale verification docs, history pagination |

## v1.2 Audit Items — Resolution Status

### High Priority

| Item | v1.2 Status | v1.2.1 Resolution | Phase |
|------|-------------|-------------------|-------|
| Missing scheduled_sends table migration | BLOCKER | RESOLVED — Created 00009b_create_scheduled_sends.sql | 17-01 |

### Medium Priority

| Item | v1.2 Status | v1.2.1 Resolution | Phase |
|------|-------------|-------------------|-------|
| Password reset redirect path mismatch | Gap | RESOLVED — Confirmed already fixed in code; documented in Phase 4 VERIFICATION.md | 17-02 |
| Phase 4 never formally verified | Gap | RESOLVED — Phase 4 VERIFICATION.md created (9/9 criteria PASSED) | 17-02 |

### Low Priority

| Item | v1.2 Status | v1.2.1 Resolution | Phase |
|------|-------------|-------------------|-------|
| No pagination UI in history | Tech debt | RESOLVED — Previous/Next pagination controls added | 18-02 |
| CONTACT_LIMITS inline duplication | Tech debt | RESOLVED — Now imports from lib/constants/billing.ts | 18-01 |
| Orphaned how-it-works.tsx | Tech debt | RESOLVED — File deleted | 18-01 |
| Phase 13 verification stale | Tech debt | RESOLVED — Updated to status: resolved, score 5/5 | 18-01 |
| Hardcoded status badge colors | Tech debt | ACCEPTED — Intentional for visual distinction, not a bug | N/A |

**Result:** 6/7 items resolved, 1 accepted as intentional design choice.

## Phase Verification Summary

Both v1.2.1 phases passed verification:

| Phase | Name | Status | Score | Verified |
|-------|------|--------|-------|----------|
| 17 | Deployment & Critical Fixes | PASSED | 4/4 | 2026-01-30 |
| 18 | Code Cleanup | PASSED | 4/4 | 2026-02-01 |

### Phase 17 Success Criteria

| # | Criterion | Status |
|---|-----------|--------|
| 1 | Migration file creates scheduled_sends table with columns, RLS, indexes | VERIFIED |
| 2 | Migration sequence runs 00009b before 00010 on fresh database | VERIFIED |
| 3 | Phase 4 VERIFICATION.md confirms all 9 success criteria | VERIFIED |
| 4 | Password reset path audit item confirmed resolved | VERIFIED |

### Phase 18 Success Criteria

| # | Criterion | Status |
|---|-----------|--------|
| 1 | components/marketing/how-it-works.tsx deleted | VERIFIED |
| 2 | send/page.tsx imports CONTACT_LIMITS from lib/constants/billing.ts | VERIFIED |
| 3 | Phase 13 VERIFICATION.md updated to resolved status | VERIFIED |
| 4 | History page pagination UI present | VERIFIED |

## Cross-Phase Integration

11 integration points verified by integration checker. 0 broken connections.

| Integration | Status | Details |
|-------------|--------|---------|
| Migration sequence (00009b → 00010) | CONNECTED | Table created before RPC functions reference it |
| Billing constants (billing.ts → send/page.tsx) | CONNECTED | Single source of truth, no inline duplication |
| History pagination (page.tsx → history-client.tsx) | CONNECTED | Props flow correctly, URL-driven state |
| Cron → scheduled_sends | CONNECTED | RPC functions + direct queries all reference table |
| Navigation (sidebar + bottom nav) | CONNECTED | All 7 links present in sidebar, 5 in bottom nav |
| Send flow E2E | CONNECTED | UI → action → Resend → database chain intact |
| Auth → all pages | CONNECTED | Middleware protects all dashboard routes |
| Business → Sending → Scheduling | CONNECTED | Business data feeds into send form and cron |
| Contacts → Sending → History | CONNECTED | Contact data flows end-to-end |
| Billing → Sending | CONNECTED | Tier limits enforced consistently |
| Onboarding → Dashboard | CONNECTED | Completion detection and card tracking |

## E2E Flows

5 user flows verified complete (up from 4 in v1.2 audit):

| Flow | Status | Key Steps |
|------|--------|-----------|
| New user signup → send test | COMPLETE | Signup → onboarding → contact → test send → dashboard |
| Daily use | COMPLETE | Login → add contact → send → view history |
| Scheduling | COMPLETE | Schedule → view pending → cron processes → history |
| Billing upgrade | COMPLETE | Hit limit → subscribe → continue sending |
| History pagination (NEW) | COMPLETE | View history → paginate through pages via URL params |

## Requirements Coverage

All 65 requirements remain satisfied. v1.2.1 has no new formal requirements (tech debt closure only).

| Milestone | Requirements | Satisfied | Coverage |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|----------|
| v1.0 | 52 | 52 | 100% |
| v1.1 | 13 | 13 | 100% |
| v1.2 | 0 (redesign) | N/A | N/A |
| v1.2.1 | 0 (tech debt) | N/A | N/A |
| **Total** | **65** | **65** | **100%** |

| 18 | Code Cleanup | v1.2.1 | passed | 4/4 |

**Summary:** 20/20 phases verified and passing. 0 unverified phases. 0 phases with unresolved gaps.

## Remaining Tech Debt

Only 2 minor items remain, neither is actionable:

1. **Password reset path (Phase 1)** — Already confirmed resolved in code. Verification documents the resolution. No action needed.
2. **Hardcoded status badge colors (Phase 9)** — Intentional design choice for visual distinction between sent/delivered/failed/opened states. Not a bug.

## Security Notes

No changes to security posture. All existing protections intact:
- RLS enabled on all tenant tables including scheduled_sends
- Service role isolated to cron and webhooks
- Secrets never exposed to client
- Rate limiting on send actions and webhook endpoints
- Zod validation on all user inputs

## Conclusion

Milestone v1.2.1 successfully closed all actionable tech debt from the v1.2 audit. The deployment blocker (missing migration) is resolved. All 20 phases across 4 milestones are verified and passing. The codebase is ready for production deployment.
