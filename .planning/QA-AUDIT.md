## Critical Findings (Must Fix)

> ✅ **All critical issues resolved by QA-FIX phase on 2026-02-05**

### C01: Onboarding Step 1 Blocked - Missing Database Column

**Severity:** CRITICAL → ✅ **RESOLVED**
**Source:** QA-AUDIT-01
**Location:** Phase 28 database migration
**Resolved By:** QA-FIX-01

**Original Issue:**
Submitting Step 1 of the onboarding wizard with a phone number triggered the error:
```
Could not find the 'phone' column of 'businesses' in the schema cache
```

**Resolution:**
Migration created: `supabase/migrations/20260206_add_business_phone_column.sql`
```sql
ALTER TABLE businesses ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS phone TEXT;
```

**Verification:** Onboarding Step 1 now accepts phone number without error.

---

### C02: Analytics Page - Missing RPC Function

**Severity:** CRITICAL → ✅ **RESOLVED**
**Source:** QA-AUDIT-02
**Location:** `lib/data/analytics.ts:45`
**Resolved By:** QA-FIX-01

**Original Issue:**
The analytics page calls `supabase.rpc('get_service_type_analytics', {...})` but this Postgres function did not exist.

**Resolution:**
Migration created: `supabase/migrations/20260206_add_service_type_analytics_rpc.sql`
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_service_type_analytics(p_business_id UUID)
RETURNS TABLE (
  service_type TEXT,
  total_sent BIGINT,
  delivered BIGINT,
  reviewed BIGINT,
  feedback_count BIGINT
) AS $$ ...
