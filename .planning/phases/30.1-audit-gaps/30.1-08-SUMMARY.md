# Phase 30.1 Plan 08: History/Activity Alignment Summary

**Aligned /history route user-facing text with "Activity" nav label - loading text, page description updated**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 1 min
- **Started:** 2026-02-06T10:19:32Z
- **Completed:** 2026-02-06T10:20:42Z
- **Tasks:** 2 (Task 2 required no changes)
- **Files modified:** 2

## Accomplishments
- Updated loading text from "Loading message history..." to "Loading activity..."
- Changed page description from "View and manage your message history" to "View your sent messages and their delivery status"
- Verified empty state text already appropriate (doesn't mention "history")
- Metadata title was already "Activity" - no change needed

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Update History page metadata and content to Activity** - `b50adb2` (chore)
2. **Task 2: Update empty state text** - No commit needed (already aligned)

**Plan metadata:** See final commit below

## Files Created/Modified
- `app/(dashboard)/history/page.tsx` - Updated loading text
- `components/history/history-client.tsx` - Updated page description

## Decisions Made
- Kept route path as `/history` for backward compatibility (no URL change needed)
- Code identifiers (HistoryClient, HistoryTable, etc.) unchanged - only user-facing text updated
- Empty state already says "No messages sent yet" which is appropriate - no change needed

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

Note: Task 2 (empty state) required no changes because the existing text ("No messages sent yet") already aligned with Activity terminology and didn't mention "history".

## Issues Encountered
None

## User Setup Required
None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness
- Phase 30.1 complete (8/8 plans)
- All audit gap remediation items addressed
- Ready to proceed with Phase 29 (Agency-Mode Readiness) or Phase 31 (Landing Page)
