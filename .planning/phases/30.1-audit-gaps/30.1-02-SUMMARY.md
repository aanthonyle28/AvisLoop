# Phase 30.1 Plan 02: Rename Send to Manual Request + Friction Warning

V2 terminology clarity: renamed Send to Manual Request, reordered nav, added friction banner.

## What Changed

### 1. Sidebar Navigation (sidebar.tsx)
- Renamed "Send" to "Manual Request"
- Moved from position 6 to position 7 (after Activity)
- Activity now at position 6, Manual Request at position 7

### 2. Mobile Bottom Navigation (bottom-nav.tsx)
- Renamed "Send" to "Manual" (shorter for mobile)
- Moved from position 2 to position 5 (last)
- New order: Dashboard, Jobs, Campaigns, Activity, Manual

### 3. Send Page Friction Warning (send-page-client.tsx)
- Added amber warning banner at top of page
- Warning icon with "fill" weight for visibility
- Message: "Campaigns handle review requests automatically"
- Guidance: "Manual sending is for one-off situations"
- Link to /campaigns for easy navigation

### 4. Page Metadata (send/page.tsx)
- Updated title from "Send" to "Manual Request"
- Browser tab and document title now show "Manual Request"

## Commits

| Task | Commit | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | ef231e0 | Rename Send to Manual Request in sidebar, move after Activity |
| 2 | 3d3437e | Rename Send to Manual in mobile bottom nav, move to last |
| 3 | f127db5 | Add friction warning banner to Send page |

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Verification

All success criteria verified:
- [x] "Send" renamed to "Manual Request" in sidebar
- [x] "Send" renamed to "Manual" in bottom nav
- [x] Nav order updated: Activity before Manual Request
- [x] Friction warning banner visible on /send page
- [x] Page title is "Manual Request"
- [x] TypeScript check passes
- [x] ESLint passes for modified files

## V2 Alignment

This change reinforces V2 philosophy:
- Manual sending is an escape hatch, not primary workflow
- Campaigns handle review requests automatically
- Navigation order emphasizes jobs/campaigns over manual actions
- Friction warning educates users about the preferred approach

## Next Phase Readiness

- No blockers identified
- Navigation changes are purely UI/UX
- Friction warning is informational, doesn't block functionality
