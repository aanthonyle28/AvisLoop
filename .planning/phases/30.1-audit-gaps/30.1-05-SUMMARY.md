# Phase 30.1 Plan 05: Preset Guidance Callout Summary

Added informational callout to new campaign page guiding users toward preset templates.

## What Was Built

### Preset Guidance Callout

A blue informational callout on `/campaigns/new` that:
- Appears prominently between the header and the form
- Uses Lightbulb icon (filled) for "tip" visual
- Explains what presets are (pre-configured sequences)
- Lists the three preset options (Conservative, Standard, Aggressive)
- Links to `/campaigns#presets` for one-click preset setup
- Supports dark mode with appropriate color adjustments

## Key Implementation Details

### Callout Structure

```tsx
<div className="mb-8 rounded-lg border border-blue-200 bg-blue-50 p-4 dark:border-blue-900/50 dark:bg-blue-950/20">
  <div className="flex items-start gap-3">
    <Lightbulb className="h-5 w-5 text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 shrink-0 mt-0.5" weight="fill" />
    <div className="flex-1">
      <p className="font-medium">New to campaigns? Start with a preset</p>
      <p className="mt-1 text-sm">Campaign presets are pre-configured sequences...</p>
      <Link href="/campaigns#presets">View presets <ArrowRight /></Link>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

### Design Decisions

| Aspect | Choice | Reason |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Color | Blue (informational) | Tip/guidance semantic |
| Position | Above form, below header | Visible but not blocking |
| Icon | Lightbulb (filled) | Universal "tip" indicator |
| CTA | Link with arrow | Clear next action |
| Tone | "New to campaigns?" | Friendly, non-judgmental |

### Spacing Adjustment

- Header `mb-8` changed to `mb-6` to accommodate callout
- Callout has `mb-8` to maintain spacing before form

## Commits

| Commit | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| ff9df80 | Add preset guidance callout to new campaign page |

## Verification Results

- `pnpm typecheck`: PASS
- `pnpm lint`: PASS
- Callout contains "preset" text
- Lightbulb icon imported and used
- Link to /campaigns#presets present

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Next Phase Readiness

**Blockers:** None

**Notes:**
- The `/campaigns#presets` anchor assumes preset picker section has id="presets"
- If preset picker doesn't have the anchor, the link still navigates to campaigns page
