# Phase 30.1 Plan 07: Campaign Preset Timing Summary

**Campaign preset cards now display timing sequence with Clock icon, channel icons, and human-readable delays (4h, 1d, 7d) in both compact and non-compact modes.**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 3 min
- **Started:** 2026-02-06T10:14:13Z
- **Completed:** 2026-02-06T10:16:42Z
- **Tasks:** 1
- **Files modified:** 1

## Accomplishments

- Added formatDelay helper function for consistent timing display
- Added Clock icon import from Phosphor
- Replaced badge-based timing with cleaner summary line
- Timing now visible in both compact and non-compact modes
- Displays channel icons (EnvelopeSimple/ChatCircle) with timing for each touch

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Add timing info to preset picker cards** - `5f9c54f` (feat)

## Files Created/Modified

- `components/campaigns/preset-picker.tsx` - Added Clock icon, formatDelay helper, timing summary line

## Decisions Made

1. **Replaced badges with summary line**: The previous implementation used Badge components with timing hidden in compact mode. Simplified to a single timing summary line with Clock icon that's always visible.

2. **formatDelay format**: Under 24 hours shows "Xh" (e.g., "4h"), 24 hours and above shows "Xd" (e.g., "1d", "3d", "7d") for readability.

3. **Removed unused Badge import**: After simplifying the design, Badge component was no longer needed.

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

- Lint error for unused Badge import after simplifying design - removed import

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

- Preset timing is now visible in all contexts (campaigns page, onboarding)
- Users can see exact touch sequence timing before selecting a preset
- Addresses QA audit item L03-02
