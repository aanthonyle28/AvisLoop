<objective>
Create the social proof strip component and wire all V2 hero components into the landing page, replacing the old hero and social proof sections.

Purpose: Complete the above-the-fold experience by adding trust signals (industry mentions, business count) immediately after the hero, and integrate everything into the live landing page.

Output: Social proof strip component + updated landing page rendering V2 hero and social proof.

# Code to reference
@components/marketing/social-proof.tsx — current social proof (keep file for rollback)
@app/(marketing)/page.tsx — landing page to update imports
@components/ui/fade-in.tsx — FadeIn wrapper from Plan 01

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create SocialProofStrip and wire landing page</name>
  <files>components/marketing/v2/social-proof-strip.tsx, app/(marketing)/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
**Create `components/marketing/v2/social-proof-strip.tsx`:**

A server component (no `'use client'` needed at this level since FadeIn handles client behavior).

Wait -- FadeIn is a client component wrapping children. The SocialProofStrip can be a server component that uses FadeIn as a client boundary. Actually, since this file imports FadeIn which is `'use client'`, the import is fine from a server component. But if there are any interactive elements, mark as client. For this component, there are no interactive elements beyond FadeIn, so it can remain a server component that imports the client FadeIn.

Structure:
1. `<section>` with `border-y border-border/30 py-12 bg-muted/30`
2. Container: `container mx-auto max-w-6xl px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8`
3. Wrap content in `<FadeIn direction="up">`
4. Inner layout: `text-center space-y-6`
5. Trust count: `<p className="text-sm font-medium text-muted-foreground uppercase tracking-wider">Trusted by 500+ businesses</p>`
6. Industry mentions row: flex wrap with industry items

Industry items array:
```ts
const industries = [
  { name: "Dentists", icon: "🦷" },
  { name: "Salons", icon: "✂️" },
  { name: "Contractors", icon: "🔧" },
  { name: "Gyms", icon: "💪" },
  { name: "Restaurants", icon: "🍽️" },
  { name: "Clinics", icon: "🏥" },
]
```

Wait -- the project avoids emojis. Use GeometricMarker instead for visual variety, or use simple text with dot separators. Better approach: use industry names as styled pills/badges for visual weight.

Revised approach -- industry pills:
```tsx
<div className="flex flex-wrap items-center justify-center gap-3 md:gap-4">
  {industries.map((industry) => (
    <span
      key={industry}
      className="inline-flex items-center gap-1.5 rounded-full border border-border/50 bg-card px-4 py-1.5 text-sm font-medium text-muted-foreground motion-safe:transition-colors hover:text-foreground hover:border-border"
    >
      <GeometricMarker variant="circle" color={colorForIndex} size="sm" />
      {industry}
    </span>
  ))}
</div>
```

Industries: `["Dentists", "Salons", "Contractors", "Gyms", "Restaurants", "Clinics"]`

Alternate colors between `lime`, `coral`, and `primary` using index modulo 3:
- Index 0, 3: lime
- Index 1, 4: coral
- Index 2, 5: primary

Import `GeometricMarker` from `@/components/ui/geometric-marker` and `FadeIn` from `@/components/ui/fade-in`.

**Update `app/(marketing)/page.tsx`:**

Replace imports:
- Remove: `import { Hero } from "@/components/marketing/hero"`
- Remove: `import { SocialProof } from "@/components/marketing/social-proof"`
- Add: `import { HeroV2 } from "@/components/marketing/v2/hero-v2"`
- Add: `import { SocialProofStrip } from "@/components/marketing/v2/social-proof-strip"`

Replace in JSX:
- `<Hero />` becomes `<HeroV2 />`
- `<SocialProof />` becomes `<SocialProofStrip />`

Keep ALL other sections exactly as they are (Features, StatsSection, Testimonials, FAQSection, CTASection). Keep ALL metadata unchanged.

Do NOT delete the old `hero.tsx` or `social-proof.tsx` files -- they serve as rollback.

**Color token compliance:**
- bg-muted/30 for section background
- border-border/30 for section borders
- bg-card for pill backgrounds
- text-muted-foreground / text-foreground for text
- No hardcoded grays or whites

Run `pnpm typecheck` -- no errors. Run `pnpm lint` -- no errors. Run `pnpm dev` and visit http://localhost:3000 -- page loads without errors. Grep `app/(marketing)/page.tsx` for "HeroV2" and "SocialProofStrip" -- both present. Grep for old "Hero" and "SocialProof" imports -- removed. Grep social-proof-strip.tsx for `bg-white`, `bg-gray`, `text-gray` -- zero matches.

  <done>SocialProofStrip displays "Trusted by 500+ businesses" with 6 industry pill badges using GeometricMarker dots and semantic color tokens. Landing page renders HeroV2 + SocialProofStrip while keeping all other sections intact.</done>

  <what-built>Complete above-the-fold experience: HeroV2 with outcome headline, animated product demo, floating cards, gradient background, and SocialProofStrip with industry pills.</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
1. Run `pnpm dev` and open http://localhost:3000
2. **Hero section checks:**
   - Headline reads "3x More Reviews in 2 Minutes" (outcome-focused, under 8 words)
   - "Start Free Trial" button visible without scrolling
   - Animated product demo on right side cycles through 3 steps (contact, message, send) every ~3 seconds
   - Floating stat card (+47%) and review card (5 stars) visible with slight rotation
   - Gradient background visible (subtle blue-to-lime tint)
3. **Social proof checks:**
   - Immediately below hero, "Trusted by 500+ businesses" text visible
   - 6 industry pills (Dentists, Salons, Contractors, Gyms, Restaurants, Clinics) with colored dots
4. **Dark mode check:**
   - Toggle to dark mode (account menu or system preference)
   - All sections readable, no white backgrounds, gradients still visible (slightly stronger)
5. **Reduced motion check:**
   - Enable reduced motion in OS settings
   - Page loads with all content visible but no animations
6. **Mobile check:**
   - Resize to 375px width
   - Hero stacks vertically (text above, demo below)
   - Social proof pills wrap to multiple rows
7. **Scroll down** -- remaining sections (Features, Stats, Testimonials, FAQ, CTA) still render correctly

5. Dark mode works across all new components
6. Reduced motion disables all animations
7. Mobile layout stacks correctly
