<objective>
Deprecate the old dashboard page, redirect to Send, and clean up all orphaned files and dead code from the redesign.

Purpose: With Send as the new home page, the old dashboard is redundant. This plan ensures clean code by removing all deprecated components, fixing any dangling imports, and verifying the full app works end-to-end.

Output: Dashboard redirects to /send. All orphaned files deleted. Clean build with no dead code.

  <name>Task 1: Redirect Dashboard and Clean Up Routes</name>
  <files>
    app/dashboard/page.tsx
    app/dashboard/layout.tsx
    app/(dashboard)/scheduled/page.tsx
  </files>
  <action>
**Dashboard page (app/dashboard/page.tsx):**
- Replace entire file with a simple Server Component redirect:
```tsx
import { redirect } from 'next/navigation'

export default function DashboardPage() {
  redirect('/send')
}
```
- This handles any bookmarks, saved URLs, or links pointing to /dashboard

**Dashboard layout (app/dashboard/layout.tsx):**
- If it exists and wraps dashboard-specific content, simplify to just pass through children
- Or delete entirely if not needed (the redirect in page.tsx means this layout barely renders)
- Check if settings page lives under this layout (`app/dashboard/settings/page.tsx`) — if so, keep the layout but simplify it

**Scheduled page (app/(dashboard)/scheduled/page.tsx):**
- Keep the page functional (accessible via direct URL)
- It's already removed from nav (Plan 01)
- No changes needed here unless there are broken imports from deleted components

**Check for stale references:**
- Search codebase for imports of deleted files:
  - `onboarding-cards` (deleted in Plan 04)
  - `onboarding-checklist` (deleted in Plan 04)
  - `quick-send` from dashboard (deleted in Plan 03)
  - `send-form` (deleted in Plan 03)
  - `contact-selector` (deleted in Plan 03)
  - `batch-results` (deleted in Plan 03)
  - `stat-cards` from dashboard (deleted in Plan 05)
  - `recent-activity` from dashboard (deleted in Plan 05)
  - `response-rate-card` (deleted in Plan 05)
- Fix or remove any remaining imports
  </action>
  <verify>
- `pnpm typecheck` passes
- `pnpm lint` passes
- Navigate to /dashboard: redirects to /send
- Navigate to /dashboard/settings: still works
- Navigate to /scheduled: still works (just not in nav)
  </verify>
  <done>/dashboard redirects to /send. Dashboard layout simplified. Scheduled page still accessible. No broken imports.</done>

  <name>Task 2: Final Dead Code Cleanup and Build Verification</name>
  <files>
    components/skeletons/dashboard-skeleton.tsx
  </files>
  <action>
**Delete orphaned skeleton:**
- Delete `components/skeletons/dashboard-skeleton.tsx` (dashboard page no longer exists with skeleton)
- Check if `components/skeletons/card-skeleton.tsx` is still used anywhere; delete if not
- Keep `components/skeletons/table-skeleton.tsx` if used by contacts or history pages

**Comprehensive dead code scan:**
- Run `pnpm typecheck` — fix ALL type errors
- Run `pnpm lint` — fix ALL lint warnings/errors
- Run `pnpm build` — verify build completes
- Check for any components in `components/dashboard/` directory that are no longer imported:
  - If the `components/dashboard/` directory is empty or only has unused files, delete the directory
  - Keep any files still imported by other parts of the app

**Verify all routes work:**
- /send (tabbed interface, Quick Send + Bulk Send)
- /contacts (unchanged)
- /history (now "Requests" with detail drawer)
- /dashboard (redirects to /send)
- /dashboard/settings (still works)
- /scheduled (still works, not in nav)
- /billing (still works)
- /onboarding (still works)

**Update page titles:**
- Ensure all pages have correct metadata titles matching new IA:
  - /send: "Send | AvisLoop"
  - /contacts: "Contacts | AvisLoop"
  - /history: "Requests | AvisLoop" (updated in Plan 07)
  </action>
  <verify>
- `pnpm typecheck` passes with zero errors
- `pnpm lint` passes with zero warnings
- `pnpm build` completes successfully
- No files in `components/dashboard/` unless still actively imported
- All routes load without errors
  </verify>
  <done>All dead code removed. Build clean. All routes functional. No orphaned files or broken imports. Phase 19 redesign is complete.</done>
