<objective>
Install react-countup, create OutcomeCardsSection and AnimatedStatsSection, then wire all four Phase 25 sections into the landing page replacing old Features and StatsSection.

Purpose: Complete the storytelling flow (empathy -> how it works -> outcomes -> trust stats) and integrate everything into the live landing page, replacing feature-focused sections with outcome-driven content.

Output: Two new components, updated landing page, react-countup dependency installed.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Install react-countup and create OutcomeCardsSection + AnimatedStatsSection</name>
  <files>components/marketing/v2/outcome-cards.tsx, components/marketing/v2/animated-stats.tsx, package.json</files>
  <action>
**Step 1: Install react-countup**

Run `pnpm add react-countup` to install the dependency. This provides the `CountUp` component with built-in `enableScrollSpy` prop.

**Step 2: Create `components/marketing/v2/outcome-cards.tsx`**

A `'use client'` component.

**Imports:**
- `FadeIn` from `@/components/ui/fade-in`
- `ThumbsUp`, `Clock`, `Heart` from `@phosphor-icons/react`

**Outcomes data array (3 items):**
```ts
const outcomes = [
  {
    icon: ThumbsUp,
    outcome: "Get More Reviews",
    benefit: "Build trust and attract new customers with a steady stream of authentic reviews. Our customers see results within the first week.",
    proof: "Average 3x more reviews in first month",
    color: "lime" as const,
  },
  {
    icon: Clock,
    outcome: "Save Time",
    benefit: "No campaigns, no automation setup, no forgotten follow-ups. Send personalized requests in seconds, not hours.",
    proof: "Send requests in under 30 seconds",
    color: "coral" as const,
  },
  {
    icon: Heart,
    outcome: "No Awkward Asks",
    benefit: "Professional email requests feel natural, not pushy. Customers appreciate the easy reminder to share their experience.",
    proof: "85% average open rate",
    color: "lime" as const,
  },
]
```

**Section structure:**
1. `<section className="py-20 md:py-28 bg-muted/30">`
2. Container: `container mx-auto max-w-5xl px-4`
3. Header wrapped in `<FadeIn direction="up">`:
   - `<h2>`: "What You Get" -- `text-3xl md:text-4xl font-bold text-balance text-center`
4. Cards grid: `grid md:grid-cols-3 gap-8 mt-12`
5. Each card wrapped in `<FadeIn direction="up" delay={i * 150}>`:
   - Card: `bg-card border border-border rounded-xl p-8 hover:shadow-lg motion-safe:transition-shadow`
   - Icon wrapper: `inline-flex items-center justify-center w-12 h-12 rounded-lg mb-4` with color bg (follow exact same lime/coral pattern from ProblemSolutionSection in 25-01)
   - Icon: `w-6 h-6` matching color, `weight="duotone"`
   - Outcome heading: `text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-foreground`
   - Benefit copy: `text-muted-foreground mb-4`
   - Proof point: `text-sm font-medium text-foreground`

**Export:** `export function OutcomeCardsSection()`

**Step 3: Create `components/marketing/v2/animated-stats.tsx`**

A `'use client'` component.

**Imports:**
- `CountUp` from `react-countup`
- `FadeIn` from `@/components/ui/fade-in`
- `GeometricMarker` from `@/components/ui/geometric-marker`

**Stats data array (4 items):**
```ts
const stats = [
  {
    end: 12500,
    suffix: "+",
    label: "Reviews Collected",
    color: "lime" as const,
    duration: 2.5,
  },
  {
    end: 500,
    suffix: "+",
    label: "Businesses Using AvisLoop",
    color: "coral" as const,
    duration: 2,
  },
  {
    end: 47,
    suffix: "%",
    label: "Average Response Rate",
    color: "lime" as const,
    duration: 2.2,
  },
  {
    end: 127,
    suffix: "",
    label: "Hours Saved Per Business",
    color: "coral" as const,
    duration: 2.3,
  },
]
```

**Section structure:**
1. `<section className="py-20 md:py-28 border-y border-border/30">`
2. Container: `container mx-auto max-w-5xl px-4`
3. Header wrapped in `<FadeIn direction="up">`:
   - `<h2>`: "Trusted by Businesses Like Yours" -- `text-3xl md:text-4xl font-bold text-balance text-center mb-12`
4. Stats grid: `grid grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-4 gap-8`
5. Each stat wrapped in `<FadeIn direction="up" delay={i * 100}>`:
   - Container: `text-center`
   - Number row: `flex items-center justify-center gap-2 mb-2`
     - `<GeometricMarker variant="triangle" color={stat.color} size="md" />`
     - Number: `text-4xl md:text-5xl font-bold text-foreground`
       - `<CountUp end={stat.end} suffix={stat.suffix} duration={stat.duration} enableScrollSpy scrollSpyOnce useEasing />`
   - Label: `text-sm text-muted-foreground`

**Export:** `export function AnimatedStatsSection()`

**Critical for CountUp:**
- `enableScrollSpy` -- auto-triggers when scrolled into view (no manual IntersectionObserver needed)
- `scrollSpyOnce` -- triggers only once (no re-animation on scroll up/down)
- `useEasing` -- smooth easing curve
- `duration` -- 2-2.5 seconds per stat
- DO NOT wrap CountUp in additional IntersectionObserver -- enableScrollSpy handles it

**Color token compliance:**
- No hardcoded grays or whites
- Follow exact same lime/coral accent pattern from 25-01 components
  </action>
  <verify>
Run `pnpm typecheck` -- no errors. Verify react-countup in package.json dependencies. Grep for `bg-white`, `bg-gray`, `text-gray` in both files -- zero matches. Confirm both export their named components. Confirm `'use client'` in both. Confirm CountUp has enableScrollSpy and scrollSpyOnce props.
  </verify>
  <done>react-countup installed. OutcomeCardsSection renders 3 benefit cards (Get More Reviews, Save Time, No Awkward Asks) with Icon/Outcome/Benefit/Proof structure. AnimatedStatsSection renders 4 scroll-triggered count-up statistics with GeometricMarker accents. Both use semantic color tokens and FadeIn animations.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Wire all Phase 25 sections into landing page</name>
  <files>app/(marketing)/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
Update `app/(marketing)/page.tsx` to integrate all 4 new Phase 25 sections.

**Remove imports:**
- `import { Features } from "@/components/marketing/features"`
- `import { StatsSection } from "@/components/marketing/stats-section"`

**Add imports:**
- `import { ProblemSolutionSection } from "@/components/marketing/v2/problem-solution"`
- `import { HowItWorksSection } from "@/components/marketing/v2/how-it-works"`
- `import { OutcomeCardsSection } from "@/components/marketing/v2/outcome-cards"`
- `import { AnimatedStatsSection } from "@/components/marketing/v2/animated-stats"`

**Update JSX section order (replace `<Features />` and `<StatsSection />`):**
```tsx
<HeroV2 />
<SocialProofStrip />
<ProblemSolutionSection />
<HowItWorksSection />
<OutcomeCardsSection />
<AnimatedStatsSection />
<Testimonials />
<FAQSection />
<CTASection />
```

**Section order rationale:**
1. HeroV2 -- value proposition (Phase 24)
2. SocialProofStrip -- trust signals (Phase 24)
3. ProblemSolutionSection -- emotional connection (Phase 25 NEW)
4. HowItWorksSection -- solution walkthrough (Phase 25 NEW, replaces Features)
5. OutcomeCardsSection -- benefits/outcomes (Phase 25 NEW, replaces Features)
6. AnimatedStatsSection -- trust statistics (Phase 25 NEW, replaces StatsSection)
7. Testimonials -- social proof (existing, Phase 26 redesign)
8. FAQSection -- objection handling (existing, Phase 26 redesign)
9. CTASection -- final CTA (existing, Phase 26 redesign)

**Keep all metadata unchanged.** Do NOT delete old `features.tsx` or `stats-section.tsx` files -- they serve as rollback.
  </action>
  <verify>
Run `pnpm typecheck` -- no errors. Run `pnpm lint` -- no errors. Grep `app/(marketing)/page.tsx` for "ProblemSolutionSection", "HowItWorksSection", "OutcomeCardsSection", "AnimatedStatsSection" -- all present. Grep for "Features" and "StatsSection" imports -- removed. Verify section order in JSX matches the specified order.
  </verify>
  <done>Landing page renders all 9 sections in correct order: HeroV2, SocialProofStrip, ProblemSolutionSection, HowItWorksSection, OutcomeCardsSection, AnimatedStatsSection, Testimonials, FAQSection, CTASection. Old Features and StatsSection replaced but files preserved for rollback.</done>

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <name>Task 3: Visual verification of all Phase 25 sections</name>
  <what-built>Complete storytelling flow: empathy section (3 pain points), How It Works (3 steps with alternating layout), outcome cards (3 benefits with proof points), and animated count-up statistics.</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
1. Run `pnpm dev` and open http://localhost:3000
2. **Scroll past hero and social proof strip**
3. **Problem section checks:**
   - "Stop Losing Reviews to Forgotten Follow-Ups" headline visible
   - 3 pain point cards (Forgetting to Ask, Awkward Asks, Complex Tools) with icons
   - Each card has emotional 2-3 sentence agitation copy
   - "AvisLoop fixes all three problems." bridge text at bottom
4. **How It Works checks:**
   - "How It Works" headline with "Three steps. Two minutes. Zero complexity." subtitle
   - 3 steps: Add Contact (left text/right image), Write Message (right text/left image), Send (left text/right image)
   - Large muted step numbers (1, 2, 3) with colored GeometricMarker dots
   - Screenshot placeholders visible
5. **Outcome cards checks:**
   - "What You Get" headline
   - 3 cards: Get More Reviews, Save Time, No Awkward Asks
   - Each has icon, headline, benefit description, and bold proof point at bottom
6. **Animated stats checks:**
   - "Trusted by Businesses Like Yours" headline
   - Scroll the stats section into view -- numbers should animate from 0 to target (12,500+, 500+, 47%, 127)
   - Each stat has a colored triangle marker
   - Numbers only animate ONCE (scroll away and back -- should not re-animate)
7. **Below stats:** Testimonials, FAQ, and CTA sections still render correctly
8. **Dark mode:** Toggle dark mode -- all new sections readable, no white backgrounds
9. **Mobile (375px width):**
   - Pain point cards stack to single column
   - How It Works steps stack vertically (text above image)
   - Outcome cards stack to single column
   - Stats show 2 columns
10. **Reduced motion:** Enable reduced motion -- all content visible without animations, CountUp numbers should still display final values
