  <name>Task 1: Run build verification</name>
  <files></files>
  <action>
Run the following checks:
1. `pnpm typecheck` -- must pass with zero errors
2. `pnpm lint` -- must pass with zero warnings/errors
3. `pnpm build` -- must complete successfully (catches SSR issues, missing imports, server/client boundary errors)

If any fail, fix the issues in the relevant files before proceeding to checkpoint.

Common issues to watch for:
- Server/client component boundary violations (importing server-only code in 'use client' components)
- Missing 'use client' directives on components using hooks or browser APIs
- TypeScript errors from mismatched types between data layer and components
- Import paths that don't resolve

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <what-built>
Complete dashboard redesign including:
- Action summary banner (all-clear vs items-pending)
- Two-tier KPI widgets (outcome metrics large, pipeline metrics smaller)
- Ready-to-send queue with service-type urgency and quick-enroll
- Attention alerts with severity sorting and contextual actions
- Navigation with Dashboard link, attention badge, "Add Job" button
- Analytics page with service type breakdowns
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
1. Start dev server: `pnpm dev`
2. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/dashboard
3. Verify dashboard layout (top to bottom): banner, KPIs, queue, alerts
4. Check KPI widgets: outcome row (large numbers) and pipeline row (smaller numbers)
5. Check banner state: if you have pending items, it should show yellow with count
6. Check sidebar: Dashboard is first item, "Add Job" button visible, badge shows on Dashboard
7. Toggle dark mode: verify all dashboard sections look correct
8. Resize to mobile: verify bottom nav has Dashboard, layout stacks vertically
9. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/analytics
10. Verify service type table renders (may be empty if no campaign data)
11. Try clicking "Enroll" on a queue item (if jobs exist)
12. Try clicking a KPI card (should navigate to detail page)
