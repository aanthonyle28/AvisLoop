<objective>
Update hero section and page metadata to reflect V2 automation-first philosophy.

Purpose: The hero is the first impression. Current V1 copy ("Send review requests instantly") contradicts V2's core value proposition where users complete jobs and automation handles the rest.

Output: Hero and metadata aligned with "Complete jobs in 10 seconds, automation handles everything" messaging.

  <name>Task 1: Update hero-v2.tsx with V2 copy</name>
  <files>components/marketing/v2/hero-v2.tsx</files>
  <action>
Update the hero section copy following V2 philosophy and research findings:

**Headline (line 30-33):**
Replace: "3x More Reviews in 2 Minutes"
With: "3x More Reviews Without Lifting a Finger"

**Subheadline (line 37-40):**
Replace: "Send review requests instantly. No complex campaigns, no forgotten follow-ups. Just results that grow your business."
With: "Complete jobs in 10 seconds. AvisLoop handles multi-touch follow-ups, timing, and review funnels automatically."

**Trust badge (line 26):**
Replace: "Trusted by 500+ local businesses"
With: "Built for home service businesses"
(More specific positioning, avoids unverified claims)

**Trust indicators (line 62-64):**
Replace: "25 free sends * 2-min setup * Cancel anytime"
With: "10-second job entry * Automated follow-ups * Cancel anytime"

**Primary CTA (line 48-49):**
Replace: "Start Free Trial"
With: "Start My Free Trial"
(First-person CTAs have +90% CTR per research)

Keep all styling, animations, and component structure unchanged. Only update text content.
