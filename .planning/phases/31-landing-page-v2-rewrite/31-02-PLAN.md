<objective>
Rewrite Problem/Solution and How It Works sections to reflect V2 automation workflow.

Purpose: Current How It Works shows V1 flow (Add Contact -> Write Message -> Send). This contradicts V2 where users complete jobs and system handles automation. Problem section incorrectly frames "complex tools" as pain when campaigns ARE the V2 product.

Output: V2-aligned workflow that shows job completion triggering automated campaigns.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Rewrite problem-solution.tsx for V2</name>
  <files>components/marketing/v2/problem-solution.tsx</files>
  <action>
Replace the painPoints array (lines 6-25) with V2-aligned pain points:

```typescript
const painPoints = [
  {
    icon: CalendarX,
    problem: 'Forgotten Follow-Ups',
    agitation: 'You finish a great service, customer leaves happy, and then... nothing. You meant to follow up but got busy with the next call. Another 5-star review lost forever.',
    color: 'lime' as const,
  },
  {
    icon: Megaphone,
    problem: 'No Follow-Up System',
    agitation: 'You ask once, move on to the next job. No reminders, no second chances. Most customers ignore the first request—they need 2-3 touches to actually leave a review.',
    color: 'coral' as const,
  },
  {
    icon: Wrench,
    problem: 'Bad Review Risk',
    agitation: 'What if they leave 1 star? One public negative review can cost thousands in lost leads. You avoid asking because you can\'t control where feedback goes.',
    color: 'lime' as const,
  },
];
```

Update section header (lines 33-38):
- Keep h2: "Stop Losing Reviews to Forgotten Follow-Ups"
- Update p text: "Home service owners work 50+ hour weeks. You don't have time to manually chase reviews. Here's what happens:"

Update solution bridge (lines 76-82):
- Keep "AvisLoop fixes all three problems."
- Update second line to: "Complete jobs in 10 seconds. System handles the rest."

Keep all styling, animations, and component structure unchanged.
  </action>
  <verify>
Run `pnpm typecheck` - should pass.
Grep for removed V1 phrase: `grep -r "Complex Tools" components/marketing/v2/problem-solution.tsx` should return nothing.
Grep for V2 phrase: `grep -r "No Follow-Up System" components/marketing/v2/problem-solution.tsx` should return match.
  </verify>
  <done>
Problem section displays V2 pain points: forgotten follow-ups, no multi-touch system, bad review risk.
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Rewrite how-it-works.tsx for V2</name>
  <files>components/marketing/v2/how-it-works.tsx</files>
  <action>
Replace the steps array (lines 6-25) with V2 workflow:

```typescript
const steps = [
  {
    number: 1,
    title: 'Complete a Job',
    description: 'Enter customer name, phone, and service type. Takes 10 seconds—do it right after the call.',
    color: 'lime' as const,
  },
  {
    number: 2,
    title: 'System Auto-Enrolls',
    description: 'AvisLoop creates the customer record, finds the matching campaign for that service type, and schedules 3 follow-up touches.',
    color: 'coral' as const,
  },
  {
    number: 3,
    title: 'Automation Runs',
    description: 'Multi-touch sequence sends over 3-5 days. Customer rates experience. 4-5 stars go to Google. 1-3 stars go to private feedback. Campaign stops automatically.',
    color: 'lime' as const,
  },
];
```

Update section header (lines 33-38):
- Keep h2: "How It Works"
- Update p text: "One action. Complete automation. More reviews."

Keep all styling, animations, layout, and screenshot placeholder structure unchanged.
  </action>

Run `pnpm typecheck` - should pass.
Grep for removed V1 steps: `grep -r "Add Contact\|Write Message" components/marketing/v2/how-it-works.tsx` should return nothing.
Grep for V2 steps: `grep -r "Complete a Job\|Auto-Enrolls\|Automation Runs" components/marketing/v2/how-it-works.tsx` should return matches.

How It Works shows V2 workflow: Complete a Job -> System Auto-Enrolls -> Automation Runs.
