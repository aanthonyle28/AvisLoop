<objective>
Update FAQ, testimonials, CTA, and pricing to complete V2 landing page transformation.

Purpose: FAQ currently answers V1 questions ("Can I customize the review request email?"). Testimonials are generic. CTA uses third-person. Pricing features list V1 terminology ("contact management", "review requests").

Output: FAQ explains V2 workflow, testimonials from home services, first-person CTA, V2 pricing features.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Rewrite faq-section.tsx for V2</name>
  <files>components/marketing/faq-section.tsx</files>
  <action>
Replace the faqs array (lines 7-38) with V2-aligned questions:

```typescript
const faqs = [
  {
    question: "How is AvisLoop different from other review platforms?",
    answer:
      "Other platforms require you to manually send each review request. AvisLoop is automation-first: complete a job, and the system handles everything—multi-touch follow-ups, timing optimization, review funnels. You spend 10 seconds per job, not 10 minutes per customer.",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens after I complete a job?",
    answer:
      "AvisLoop automatically creates a customer record (if new) or links to existing customer, finds the campaign matching your service type (HVAC, plumbing, etc.), and schedules 2-3 follow-up touches over 3-5 days. The first message sends 24-72 hours after job completion (varies by service). You don't do anything else.",
  },
  {
    question: "What's a campaign and do I need to set one up?",
    answer:
      "Campaigns are pre-built multi-touch sequences. During onboarding, you choose a preset (Fast, Standard, or Slow) and AvisLoop creates campaigns for each service type you offer. These run automatically—you never manually trigger a campaign. Just complete jobs.",
  },
  {
    question: "What's the review funnel and why does it matter?",
    answer:
      "The review funnel protects your Google rating. When a customer clicks your review link, they rate their experience 1-5 stars privately first. 4-5 stars redirects to Google for a public review. 1-3 stars shows a private feedback form so you can fix the issue before it goes public.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to import my customer list?",
    answer:
      "No. AvisLoop creates customers automatically when you complete jobs. Most businesses start with zero customers and build their list organically as they work. Customer import is optional—not the primary workflow.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is my customer data safe?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. All data is encrypted in transit and at rest. We never share or sell your customer information. Your data stays yours.",
  },
];
```

Also migrate the lucide-react import to Phosphor:
- Replace: `import { ChevronDown } from "lucide-react";`
- With: `import { CaretDown } from "@phosphor-icons/react";`
- Update component usage: `<ChevronDown` -> `<CaretDown weight="bold"` and remove `className="h-5 w-5"` in favor of `size={20}`
  </action>

Run `pnpm typecheck` - should pass.
Grep for V1 FAQ: `grep -r "one contact, one click" components/marketing/faq-section.tsx` should return nothing.
Grep for V2 FAQ: `grep -r "complete a job" components/marketing/faq-section.tsx` should return match.
  </verify>
  <done>
FAQ displays V2 questions explaining campaigns, job completion, and review funnel.
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Update testimonials.tsx for home services</name>
  <files>components/marketing/testimonials.tsx</files>
  <action>
Replace the testimonials array (lines 1-17) with home service business testimonials:

```typescript
const testimonials = [
  {
    quote: "I complete jobs on my phone between calls. AvisLoop handles the rest. Went from 12 to 47 Google reviews in two months.",
    author: "Mike Rodriguez",
    role: "Rodriguez HVAC, Phoenix AZ",
  },
  {
    quote: "The review funnel is genius. Bad experiences go to private feedback, good ones to Google. My rating went from 4.1 to 4.8.",
    author: "Sarah Chen",
    role: "Premier Plumbing Solutions",
  },
  {
    quote: "Finally something that doesn't require me to remember to follow up. System just runs. I just do my job.",
    author: "James Thompson",
    role: "Thompson Electric",
  },
];
```

These testimonials emphasize:
- Job completion workflow (Mike)
- Review funnel protection (Sarah)
- Automation / set-and-forget (James)
- Home service businesses specifically
  </action>

Run `pnpm typecheck` - should pass.
Grep for home service testimonials: `grep -r "HVAC\|Plumbing\|Electric" components/marketing/testimonials.tsx` should return matches.
  </verify>
  <done>

</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Update cta-section.tsx with first-person CTA</name>
  <files>components/marketing/cta-section.tsx</files>
  <action>
Update the CTA section (lines 9-18):

**Headline (line 9):**
Replace: "Start getting more reviews today"
With: "Start getting 3x more reviews today"

**Subheadline (line 12):**
Replace: "25 free sends included. No credit card required."
With: "10-second job entry. Automated follow-ups. No credit card required."

**Button text (line 16):**
Replace: "Get Started Free"
With: "Start My Free Trial"
(First-person CTAs have +90% CTR per research)
  </action>
  <verify>
Run `pnpm typecheck` - should pass.
Grep for first-person CTA: `grep -r "Start My Free Trial" components/marketing/cta-section.tsx` should return match.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 4: Update pricing-table.tsx features for V2</name>
  <files>components/marketing/pricing-table.tsx</files>
  <action>

**Free Trial tier features (lines 32-36):**
```typescript
features: [
  "25 free campaign touches",
  "All features included",
  "Multi-touch campaigns",
  "Email + SMS support",
  "No credit card required",
],
```

**Basic tier features (lines 47-51):**
