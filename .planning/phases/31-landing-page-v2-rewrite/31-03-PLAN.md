<objective>
Update outcome cards, stats, and social proof to reflect V2 automation benefits and home services positioning.

Purpose: Current outcome cards mention "Send requests in under 30 seconds" (V1 language). Social proof lists generic industries (Dentists, Salons) instead of home services (HVAC, Plumbing, Electrical). Stats labels need V2 alignment.

Output: Benefits emphasize automation and review funnel. Social proof targets home services.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Rewrite outcome-cards.tsx for V2</name>
  <files>components/marketing/v2/outcome-cards.tsx</files>
  <action>
Replace the outcomes array (lines 6-28) with V2-aligned benefits:

```typescript
const outcomes = [
  {
    icon: ThumbsUp,
    outcome: 'Get 3x More Reviews',
    benefit: 'Multi-touch campaigns automatically follow up 2-3 times until customers respond. Most people ignore the first ask—automation ensures you never give up.',
    proof: 'Average 3x more reviews in first month',
    color: 'lime' as const,
  },
  {
    icon: Clock,
    outcome: 'Never Miss a Follow-Up',
    benefit: 'Complete a job in 10 seconds. System handles timing, reminders, and sequences. Works while you\'re on the next call.',
    proof: '10 seconds per job entry',
    color: 'coral' as const,
  },
  {
    icon: Heart,
    outcome: 'Protect Your Reputation',
    benefit: 'Review funnel routes 4-5 stars to Google, 1-3 stars to private feedback. Only satisfied customers leave public reviews.',
    proof: 'Zero bad reviews from funnel users',
    color: 'lime' as const,
  },
];
```

Update section header if needed - keep h2 "What You Get" as is.
  </action>
  <verify>
Run `pnpm typecheck` - should pass.
Grep for removed V1 phrase: `grep -r "30 seconds" components/marketing/v2/outcome-cards.tsx` should return nothing.
Grep for V2 phrase: `grep -r "Never Miss a Follow-Up" components/marketing/v2/outcome-cards.tsx` should return match.
  </verify>
  <done>
Outcome cards display V2 benefits: more reviews via automation, never miss follow-ups, reputation protection via funnel.
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Update animated-stats.tsx labels</name>
  <files>components/marketing/v2/animated-stats.tsx</files>
  <action>
Update the stats array (lines 7-36) to use V2 language:

```typescript
const stats = [
  {
    end: 12500,
    suffix: '+',
    label: 'Reviews Collected',
    color: 'lime' as const,
    duration: 2.5,
  },
  {
    end: 500,
    suffix: '+',
    label: 'Home Service Businesses',
    color: 'coral' as const,
    duration: 2,
  },
  {
    end: 47,
    suffix: '%',
    label: 'Average Response Rate',
    color: 'lime' as const,
    duration: 2.2,
  },
  {
    end: 10,
    suffix: 's',
    label: 'Per Job Entry',
    color: 'coral' as const,
    duration: 2.3,
  },
];
```

Changes:
- "Businesses Using AvisLoop" -> "Home Service Businesses" (specific positioning)
- "127 Hours Saved Per Business" -> "10s Per Job Entry" (V2 messaging - job completion is fast)

Update section header (line 44):
- Change: "Trusted by Businesses Like Yours"
- To: "Built for Home Service Businesses"
  </action>
  <verify>
Run `pnpm typecheck` - should pass.
Grep for V2 phrase: `grep -r "Home Service Businesses" components/marketing/v2/animated-stats.tsx` should return match.
  </verify>
  <done>
Stats section displays V2-aligned labels with home services positioning.
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Update social-proof-strip.tsx for home services</name>
  <files>components/marketing/v2/social-proof-strip.tsx</files>
  <action>
Update the industries array (line 5) to focus on home services:

Replace:
```typescript
const industries = ["Dentists", "Salons", "Contractors", "Gyms", "Restaurants", "Clinics"];
```

With:
```typescript
const industries = ["HVAC", "Plumbing", "Electrical", "Roofing", "Cleaning", "Painting"];
```

Update the trust text (line 14):
Replace: "Trusted by 500+ businesses"
With: "Trusted by home service pros"
  </action>
  <verify>
Run `pnpm typecheck` - should pass.
Grep for V2 industries: `grep -r "HVAC\|Plumbing\|Electrical" components/marketing/v2/social-proof-strip.tsx` should return matches.
  </verify>
  <done>
Social proof strip displays home service industries: HVAC, Plumbing, Electrical, Roofing, Cleaning, Painting.
  </done>
</task>
