  <how-to-verify>
1. Start dev server: `pnpm dev`
2. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/dashboard

**Desktop (lg+ viewport, 1280px+ width):**
- [ ] Two-column layout: left column with task lists, right panel (~360px) with KPIs + activity
- [ ] Right panel shows 3 KPI cards (Reviews, Rating, Conversion) with trends
- [ ] Right panel shows 3 pipeline counters (Sent, Active, Queued)
- [ ] Right panel shows recent activity feed with event icons
- [ ] Greeting shows "Good morning/afternoon/evening, {Name}" with dynamic subtitle
- [ ] Subtitle shows job/alert counts or summary stats when caught up
- [ ] "+ Add Job" button (primary) and "View Campaigns" (outline) in header
- [ ] Ready to Send shows compact rows with customer name, service badge, time, campaign name
- [ ] Needs Attention shows compact rows with colored left border (red/amber)
- [ ] Click a Ready to Send job → right panel slides to job detail
- [ ] Job detail shows customer info, service type, campaign data, notes, Enroll CTA
- [ ] Click Enroll → job enrolls, toast success, panel returns to default
- [ ] Click X on job detail → returns to default KPI/activity view
- [ ] Click a Needs Attention alert → right panel shows contextual detail
- [ ] Failed send detail shows error + Retry button
- [ ] Unresolved feedback detail shows rating + Resolve link
- [ ] Enroll All button in Ready to Send header with confirmation dialog
- [ ] Sidebar shows dashboard badge with combined count (no notification bell)

**Mobile (resize to < 1024px width):**
- [ ] Single column layout, no right panel visible
- [ ] Compact KPI summary bar at top ("X reviews · X.X avg · X% conv")
- [ ] Task lists visible immediately without scrolling
- [ ] Tap KPI summary → bottom sheet opens with full KPI/activity view
- [ ] Tap a job item → bottom sheet opens with job detail
- [ ] Tap an alert item → bottom sheet opens with alert detail
- [ ] X button closes bottom sheet
- [ ] Bottom nav still visible and functional

**Dark mode (toggle theme):**
- [ ] All new components render correctly in dark mode
- [ ] Right panel border visible in dark mode
- [ ] KPI cards, activity feed, detail views all use proper dark mode colors
- [ ] Bottom sheet overlay and content correct in dark mode

**Getting Started (test with new account or reset checklist):**
- [ ] Before first job: Getting Started full card shows in right panel
- [ ] After first job but before first review: compact checklist
- [ ] Setup progress pill does NOT show on dashboard (shows on other pages)

**Edge cases:**
- [ ] Empty states: no ready jobs, no alerts — left column shows empty state messages
- [ ] Many jobs (5+): "Show all" link appears
- [ ] Conflict jobs still show Replace/Skip/Queue buttons
