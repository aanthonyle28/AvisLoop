## Key Changes

### Maintainability Improvements

1. **CONTACT_LIMITS centralized** in `lib/constants/billing.ts`
   - Single source of truth for tier contact limits
   - Imported in billing page instead of inline definition

2. **Shared onboarding types** extracted to `lib/types/onboarding.ts`
   - `OnboardingBusiness`, `OnboardingContact`, `OnboardingTemplate` types
   - Used by both onboarding-wizard.tsx and onboarding-steps.tsx
   - Eliminates duplicate type definitions

3. **Step count comment** clarified in onboarding page
   - Documents 3-step wizard structure (Business, Contact, Send)
   - Notes that Review Link is part of Business step

### UX Improvements

4. **Broken footer links removed**
   - Removed links to non-existent About, Contact, Privacy, Terms pages
   - Replaced with "Coming soon" placeholder text
   - Will be added in Phase 9 if needed

5. **Auth page branding** added
   - Login and sign-up pages now show AvisLoop logo header
   - Links back to home page for navigation
   - Consistent branding experience

### SEO Improvements

6. **Dynamic copyright year** in footer
   - Uses `new Date().getFullYear()` for current year
   - Eliminates need for annual manual updates

### Accessibility Improvements

7. **ARIA attributes** added to onboarding progress
   - Container: `role="group"` with descriptive `aria-label`
   - Desktop stepper: Changed from `div` to `nav` with `aria-label`
   - Step indicators: `aria-current="step"` for current step
   - Step labels: `aria-label` with title and completion status
   - Decorative elements: `aria-hidden="true"` on icons, lines, visual labels

## Verification Results

- `pnpm lint` - Passed
- `pnpm typecheck` - Passed
- Footer displays without 404 links
- Auth pages show AvisLoop branding
- Copyright shows current year (2026)
- Progress component has proper ARIA semantics
