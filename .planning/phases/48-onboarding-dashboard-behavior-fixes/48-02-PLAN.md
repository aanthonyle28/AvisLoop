## Objective

Redesign the campaign preset picker in onboarding step 5 so it uses a vertical stack layout with Standard in the middle, removes jargon (touch badges), and fixes the subtitle copy to reference "Campaigns" not "Settings".

## Context

@components/onboarding/steps/campaign-preset-step.tsx — the single file to modify
@lib/constants/campaigns.ts — `CAMPAIGN_PRESETS` array defines the 3 presets in order: conservative (index 0), standard (index 1), aggressive (index 2). The presets from the database may arrive in any order. The component already matches them via `CAMPAIGN_PRESETS.find(p => preset.name.toLowerCase().includes(p.id))`.

### Current state of the file

The component currently:
1. Uses `grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3 gap-4` (3-column grid on desktop) — **ONB-01 wants vertical stack always**
2. Shows touch badges with channel icons and timing (email 24h, sms Day 7, etc.) — **ONB-02 wants these removed**
3. Subtitle says "You can customize it later in Settings." — **ONB-03 wants "You can change this later in Campaigns."**
4. Preset order depends on database fetch order, which may not be conservative → standard → aggressive

### CAMPAIGN_PRESETS order (from constants)
- Index 0: `conservative` — "Gentle Follow-Up"
- Index 1: `standard` — "Standard Follow-Up"
- Index 2: `aggressive` — "Aggressive Follow-Up"

This order already puts Standard in the middle (index 1). We need to sort `presetsWithMeta` by this index.

## Tasks

<task id="1">
### Fix subtitle copy (ONB-03)

**File: `components/onboarding/steps/campaign-preset-step.tsx`**

Change line 64 from:
```
Select a campaign style. You can customize it later in Settings.
```
To:
```
Select a campaign style. You can change this later in Campaigns.
```
</task>

<task id="2">
### Sort presets and switch to vertical stack layout (ONB-01)

**File: `components/onboarding/steps/campaign-preset-step.tsx`**

**Sort presets for correct display order:**
After the `presetsWithMeta` mapping (after line 38), add a sort:
```typescript
// Sort to match CAMPAIGN_PRESETS order: conservative → standard → aggressive
const sortedPresets = [...presetsWithMeta].sort((a, b) => {
  const aIdx = CAMPAIGN_PRESETS.findIndex(p => p.id === a.meta?.id)
  const bIdx = CAMPAIGN_PRESETS.findIndex(p => p.id === b.meta?.id)
  return (aIdx === -1 ? 99 : aIdx) - (bIdx === -1 ? 99 : bIdx)
})
```

Then use `sortedPresets` instead of `presetsWithMeta` in the JSX map.

**Change layout from grid to vertical stack:**
Change the container div (line 69) from:
```tsx
<div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3 gap-4" role="radiogroup" ...>
```
To:
```tsx
<div className="flex flex-col gap-3 max-w-lg mx-auto" role="radiogroup" ...>
```

The `max-w-lg mx-auto` centers the stack and constrains width so the cards don't stretch across the full page on desktop. This creates a clean, focused vertical selection flow.
</task>

<task id="3">
### Remove touch visualization badges, keep plain-English description (ONB-02)

**File: `components/onboarding/steps/campaign-preset-step.tsx`**

Remove the entire "Touch visualization" block (currently lines 102-130) — the `<div className="flex items-center gap-2 flex-wrap">` containing the badge loop with `EnvelopeSimple` and `ChatCircle` icons and delay calculations.

The plain-English descriptions from `CAMPAIGN_PRESETS` are already shown in the `<p>` tag on line 97-99 (e.g., "Two emails over 3 days. Good for established relationships or high-ticket services."). These descriptions are sufficient and jargon-free.

After removing the touch visualization, also remove the now-unused imports:
- Remove `Badge` from `'@/components/ui/badge'`
- Remove `EnvelopeSimple, ChatCircle` from `'@phosphor-icons/react'`

The preset card should now contain only:
1. Title (`preset.meta?.name || preset.name`)
2. Plain-English description (`preset.meta?.description || ...`)

No badges, no channel icons, no timing calculations.
</task>

## Verification

```bash
pnpm lint && pnpm typecheck
```

### must_haves
- [ ] Preset picker layout is `flex flex-col` (not `grid grid-cols-3`)
- [ ] Presets are sorted: Gentle (conservative) first, Standard (standard) middle, Aggressive (aggressive) last
- [ ] Touch visualization badges are completely removed (no `<Badge>` elements, no `EnvelopeSimple`/`ChatCircle` icons in this file)
- [ ] Each preset card shows only title and plain-English description text
- [ ] Subtitle reads "You can change this later in Campaigns." (not "in Settings")
- [ ] `Badge` import removed from the file (unused)
- [ ] `EnvelopeSimple` and `ChatCircle` imports removed from the file (unused)
- [ ] `pnpm lint` passes
- [ ] `pnpm typecheck` passes
